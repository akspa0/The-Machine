# The-Machine: Core and Extension Dependencies
#
# ⚠️ We STRONGLY recommend using Anaconda/conda to manage your environment, especially for PyTorch and GPU support.
# See the README for full conda setup instructions.
#
# If you must use pip, install the correct torch/torchaudio version for your system from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
#
# This requirements.txt is for all core and extension features. Some extensions may require additional packages.

# Core dependencies
# (Install torch/torchaudio via conda for best compatibility)
torch>=2.0.0
# For GPU, install torch/torchaudio with CUDA support from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
torchaudio>=2.0.0
tqdm
rich
numpy
soundfile
mutagen
pydub
scipy
colorama
pyyaml

# Speaker diarization
pyannote.audio

# ComfyUI (node-based UI for pipeline)

# Conda installation instructions (recommended for PyTorch):
#
# 1. Create a new environment:
#    conda create -n themachine python=3.10
#    conda activate themachine
#
# 2. Install PyTorch (choose the right CUDA version for your system):
#    See https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for the latest command.
#    Example (CPU only):
#      conda install pytorch torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
#    Example (CUDA 11.8):
#      conda install pytorch torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia
#
# 3. Install the rest of the dependencies:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
